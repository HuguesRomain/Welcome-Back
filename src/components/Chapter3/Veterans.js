              Created in 1971, the VVAW worked, after the war, to ensure that the vets received treatment and benefits for the PTSD and the diseases caused by the Agent Orange.<br /><br />

              They were the <span className='yellow__span'>first to hear veterans</span> suffering from PTSD and to offer therapies.Through their work the syndrome is <span className='yellow__span'>officially recognized in 1980</span>.

            <p className='part__Veterans__text'>
            In a first time, considerated unpatriotic and anti-american by the others vets, they earned respect by the help done and others associations joined the VVAW.<br/><br/>

Members have even taken legal actions and won compensations from the companies like Monsanto who created Agent Orange (200 000 
complainants).
